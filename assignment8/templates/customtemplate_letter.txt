Dear [[first_name]] [[last_name]],

Thank you so much for your gift at our recent wedding! Your personal touch in choosing the gift
meant so much to us. The way it complements both of our interests is truly amazing.

The least we can do to thank you is write a personal note to tell you so. So again, from the bottom
of our hearts, thank you.

Love,

John & Jane Doe
